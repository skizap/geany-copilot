# Geany Copilot Critical Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the four critical improvements implemented for the Geany Copilot Python plugin, prioritized for enhanced functionality and performance.

## âœ… 1. Fixed Text Selection Handling

### Problem
The original `_get_current_selection()` method returned placeholder text instead of actual selected text from the Geany editor buffer.

### Solution
- **Enhanced `utils/helpers.py`** with proper Scintilla API integration:
  - `get_selected_text()` - Retrieves actual selected text using `scintilla.get_text_range()`
  - `replace_selected_text()` - Replaces selection using `scintilla.replace_sel()`
  - `get_cursor_position()` - Gets accurate cursor position with line/column
  - `get_document_text()` - Retrieves full document content
  - `insert_text_at_cursor()` - Inserts text at cursor position
  - `get_line_text()` - Gets specific line content
  - `get_context_around_cursor()` - Gets context around cursor (similar to Lua implementation)

- **Updated `core/context.py`** to use the improved helper functions
- **Updated main plugin class** to use the enhanced selection handling

### Testing
- Created `test_text_selection.py` with comprehensive tests
- All tests pass âœ…
- Supports various selection scenarios (single line, multi-line, no selection)

## âœ… 2. Integrated Streaming Support with UI Dialogs

### Problem
UI dialogs showed static responses without real-time streaming, making the interface feel unresponsive during AI processing.

### Solution
- **Enhanced CodeAssistantDialog** with streaming capabilities:
  - Real-time text updates as AI generates responses
  - Progressive message building in chat interface
  - Streaming toggle checkbox for user control
  - Proper error handling for interrupted streams

- **Enhanced CopywriterDialog** with streaming support:
  - Real-time text processing display
  - Progressive updates in improved text area
  - Streaming toggle for processing modes
  - Responsive UI during long operations

- **Streaming callback system**:
  - `_on_thinking_start()` - Shows processing status
  - `_on_response_chunk()` - Handles incremental updates
  - `_on_streaming_error()` - Manages streaming errors
  - UI remains responsive with `gtk.main_iteration()`

### Testing
- Created `test_streaming.py` with comprehensive tests
- All tests pass âœ…
- Verified callback setup and UI streaming methods

## âœ… 3. Enhanced Context Analysis with Automatic Language Detection

### Problem
Basic language detection relied only on file extensions, missing content-based detection and language-specific AI assistance.

### Solution
- **Created `core/language_detector.py`** with advanced detection:
  - **Multi-method detection**: File extension, shebang, content patterns, Geany filetype
  - **Comprehensive language support**: 30+ programming languages and file types
  - **Confidence scoring**: Weighted detection with confidence levels
  - **Content analysis**: Pattern matching for language-specific constructs
  - **Language categorization**: Programming, web, markup, data, config, etc.

- **Enhanced `core/context.py`** with language intelligence:
  - `get_language_info()` - Detailed language detection results
  - `get_language_context()` - Language-specific context for AI prompts
  - Language-specific suggestions and best practices
  - Common patterns and guidelines for each language

- **Improved AI context formatting**:
  - Language category information
  - Detection confidence levels
  - Language-specific guidelines in prompts
  - Enhanced context for better AI responses

### Testing
- Created `test_language_detection.py` with extensive tests
- All tests pass âœ…
- Supports extension detection, shebang parsing, content analysis, and pattern matching

## âœ… 4. Added Performance Optimizations Including Caching

### Problem
No caching mechanism led to repeated API calls, potential memory issues with large files, and no request debouncing.

### Solution
- **Created `core/cache.py`** with comprehensive performance management:

#### LRU Cache System
- **Size-based eviction**: Configurable maximum entries
- **Memory-based limits**: Maximum memory usage in MB
- **TTL expiration**: Time-based cache invalidation
- **Access tracking**: Frequency and recency monitoring
- **Automatic cleanup**: Expired entry removal

#### Request Debouncer
- **Configurable delays**: Prevent excessive API calls
- **Multi-key support**: Independent debouncing per request type
- **Thread-safe operation**: Concurrent request handling
- **Cancellation support**: Cancel pending requests

#### Memory Optimizer
- **Usage monitoring**: Real-time memory statistics
- **Garbage collection**: Forced cleanup when needed
- **Object tracking**: Weak reference monitoring
- **Memory reporting**: RSS, VMS, and percentage usage

#### Performance Manager Integration
- **Unified interface**: Coordinates all performance features
- **Cache key generation**: Consistent hashing for requests
- **Statistics tracking**: Hit rates, memory usage, uptime
- **Automatic maintenance**: Periodic cleanup and optimization

- **Enhanced `core/agent.py`** with performance integration:
  - Response caching for repeated queries
  - Cache key generation based on request content
  - Performance statistics and monitoring
  - Automatic cleanup and maintenance

- **Updated `core/config.py`** with performance settings:
  - Cache configuration (size, memory, TTL)
  - Debounce settings (delay timing)
  - Memory optimization options

### Testing
- Created `test_performance.py` with comprehensive tests
- All tests pass âœ…
- Verified caching, debouncing, memory optimization, and agent integration
