- api_client.py catches RequestException and generic exceptions, returning APIResponse with error details.
- AIAgent transitions conversation state to ERROR and surfaces errors via on_error callback.

---

## Cleanup and Resource Management

- UI: Menu items and dialogs are destroyed in GeanyCopilotPlugin.cleanup().
- Agent: ai_agent.cleanup() clears conversations and closes API sessions.
- APIClient: session is closed in cleanup().

Recommended improvements (already analyzed):
- Ensure only a single cleanup implementation in AIAgent and enforce conversation trimming by updated_at/time.
- Disconnect any Geany signals explicitly on cleanup if GeanyPy requires handler IDs.
- Apply cache TTLs and limits in PerformanceManager.
