## Installation

### **Python Version (Recommended)**

**🚀 Automated Installation:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skizap/geany-copilot.git
cd geany-copilot
./install.sh
```

The installation script automatically:
- ✅ Checks prerequisites (Python 3.6+, pip, Geany)
- ✅ Moves legacy Lua files to `OLD/` directory
- ✅ Installs Python dependencies (`requests`, `keyring` for secure API key storage)
- ✅ Copies plugin files to appropriate Geany directory
- ✅ Sets secure file permissions (600) on configuration files
- ✅ Verifies installation and runs comprehensive tests

**📋 Prerequisites:**
- **Geany IDE** with GeanyPy plugin support
- **Python 3.6+** (Python 3.8+ recommended)
- **pip** package manager

**📚 Detailed Instructions:** See [INSTALL_GUIDE.md](INSTALL_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive installation guide.

### **Lua Version (Legacy)**

**⚠️ Note**: The Lua version is preserved for compatibility but is no longer actively developed. New users should use the Python version.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Geany IDE** with Lua scripting support
- **Dependencies**: `lunajson` library and `cURL`

**Steps:**

1. **Restore Legacy Files** (if you want to use the Lua version):
   ```bash
   cp OLD/*.lua ./
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure that the `lunajson` library is available. You can install it using LuaRocks:

   ```bash
   luarocks install lunajson
   ```

   Additionally, ensure that `cURL` is installed on your system:

   ```bash
   # For Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install curl

   # For macOS using Homebrew
   brew install curl
   ```

4. **Place the Plugins in Geany's Plugin Directory:**

   Copy the Lua scripts (`copilot.lua` and `copywriter.lua`) to Geany's plugin or script directory, typically located at `~/.config/geany/plugins/` or a similar path depending on your operating system.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot/
   cp copilot.lua copywriter.lua ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot/
   ```

5. **Restart Geany:**

   After placing the plugins, restart Geany in case the lua scripts didn't load automatically.

## Configuration

Geany Copilot features **enterprise-grade configuration management** with automatic validation, secure credential storage, and health monitoring. The Python version provides enhanced security and user experience compared to the legacy Lua version.

### 🔒 **Secure Configuration Features**

     - **OS Keyring** (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service) - **Recommended**
     - **Environment Variables** (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) - **Secure fallback**
     - **Configuration file** - **Not recommended for production**

   **🔒 Security Note:** The plugin automatically detects and uses the most secure storage method available on your system.

   **🌐 Supported Providers:** Any OpenAI-compatible API (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Ollama, llama-server, etc.)

4. **Customize System Prompt:**

   - **Code Assistance:** Defines the behavior of the AI assistant for coding tasks.

   Upon selection, the chosen code snippet will replace the original selection.

### Copywriting Assistance

**Geany Copilot** also offers creative copywriting assistance, helping you generate and refine written content directly within the Geany editor.

#### Performing Copywriting Tasks

1. **Select Text or Position Caret:**

   - To generate new content, place the caret where you want the text to be inserted.
   - To review or refine existing text, highlight the text you wish to work on.

2. **Invoke Copywriting Assistant:**

   - Use a designated keyboard shortcut.
   - Access via the plugin menu.

3. **Choose an Action:**

   - **Generate Content:** Create new text based on the provided context.
   - **Review Text:** Get constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

4. **Review and Apply Suggestions:**

   The assistant will display a dialog with AI-generated suggestions. Choose the appropriate option to insert or replace text, depending on your configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### 🔧 **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **API Key Issues**
- **Problem**: "API key not found" or authentication errors
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Check keyring storage**: `python3 -c "import keyring; print(keyring.get_password('geany-copilot', 'deepseek_api_key'))"`
  2. **Use environment variables**: `export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-key-here"`
  3. **Verify API key validity**: Test with a simple API call
  4. **Check configuration health**: Use the built-in health report feature

#### **Performance Issues**
- **Problem**: Slow responses or high memory usage
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Check cache efficiency**: View cache hit rates in performance stats
  2. **Optimize cache settings**: Increase cache size or memory limits
  3. **Monitor system health**: Use the built-in health monitoring
  4. **Clear cache**: Reset cache if it becomes corrupted

## Migration Guide

### **From Lua to Python Version**

If you're currently using the Lua version and want to upgrade to the Python version:

1. **Backup Your Configuration** (optional):
   ```bash
   cp ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot-python/config.json ~/geany-copilot-backup.json
   ```

2. **Run the Installation Script**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
   The script automatically moves your Lua files to the `OLD/` directory and installs the Python version.

3. **Reconfigure API Settings**:
   - Go to **Tools → Copilot → Settings** in Geany
   - Enter your API key and configure preferences
   - The Python version supports additional providers like DeepSeek

4. **Test the New Features**:
   - Try the enhanced code assistant with multi-turn conversations
   - Explore the improved copywriting interface
   - Experience better error handling and logging

### **Reverting to Lua Version**

If you need to revert to the Lua version:

1. **Remove Python Plugin**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/geany/plugins/geany-copilot-python/
   ```

2. **Restore Lua Files**:
   ```bash
   cp OLD/*.lua ./
   ```

3. **Reconfigure Geany** to use the Lua scripts as before.

## GeanyPy Installation Guide

### **For Linux Mint Users (Your System)**

Since you're using **Linux Mint with Geany 2.1.0**, here are the specific steps to install GeanyPy:

#### **Quick Installation**
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install GeanyPy (try these in order)
sudo apt install geany-plugin-py
# OR if the above fails:
sudo apt install geany-plugins

# Install Python GTK dependencies
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

#### **Verification Steps**
1. **Restart Geany completely**: `killall geany && geany`
2. **Open Plugin Manager**: Tools → Plugin Manager
3. **Look for GeanyPy**: Should appear in the plugin list
4. **Enable GeanyPy**: Check the checkbox and click OK
5. **Test**: Look for Python plugin support

#### **Troubleshooting Script**
If GeanyPy doesn't appear, run our troubleshooting script:
```bash
./troubleshoot_geanypy.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Detect your exact Linux Mint version
- ✅ Check for GeanyPy packages
- ✅ Install missing dependencies
- ✅ Test Python GTK bindings
- ✅ Create a test plugin to verify functionality
- ✅ Provide specific fixes for your system

#### **Alternative Package Names**
Different Linux distributions use different package names:

| Distribution | Package Name |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Linux Mint/Ubuntu/Debian** | `geany-plugin-py` or `geany-plugins` |
| **Fedora/CentOS** | `geany-plugins-geanypy` |
| **Arch Linux** | `geany-plugins` |
| **openSUSE** | `geany-plugin-geanypy` |

#### **Manual Verification**
Check if GeanyPy is installed:
```bash
# Check installed packages
dpkg -l | grep geany-plugin

# Look for GeanyPy files
find /usr -name "*geanypy*" 2>/dev/null
find /usr -name "*py.so" 2>/dev/null

# Test Python GTK
python3 -c "import gi; gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0'); from gi.repository import Gtk; print('GTK OK')"
```

#### **If GeanyPy Still Doesn't Work**
1. **Check detailed guide**: See [GEANYPY_INSTALLATION.md](GEANYPY_INSTALLATION.md)
2. **Use troubleshooting script**: `./troubleshoot_geanypy.sh`
3. **Fallback to Lua version**: Files preserved in `OLD/` directory
4. **Report issue**: Include your system details and error messages

### **Understanding GeanyPy vs Other Plugins**

**GeanyPy** is special because it's a "plugin framework" that allows Python scripts to act as Geany plugins:

- **Regular Geany plugins**: Written in C/C++, compiled as `.so` files
- **GeanyPy plugins**: Written in Python, loaded through GeanyPy framework
- **GeanyLua plugins**: Written in Lua (what we're migrating from)

**Why GeanyPy is Required:**
- Our Python plugin uses GeanyPy's API to integrate with Geany
- Without GeanyPy, Python plugins cannot access Geany's interface
- GeanyPy provides the bridge between Python and Geany's C API
