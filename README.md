- **pip** package manager

**üìö Detailed Instructions:** See [INSTALL_GUIDE.md](INSTALL_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive installation guide.

### **Lua Version (Legacy)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: The Lua version is preserved for compatibility but is no longer actively developed. New users should use the Python version.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Geany IDE** with Lua scripting support
- **Dependencies**: `lunajson` library and `cURL`

**Steps:**

1. **Restore Legacy Files** (if you want to use the Lua version):
   ```bash
   cp OLD/*.lua ./
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure that the `lunajson` library is available. You can install it using LuaRocks:

   ```bash
   luarocks install lunajson
   ```

   Additionally, ensure that `cURL` is installed on your system:

   ```bash
   # For Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install curl

   # For macOS using Homebrew
   brew install curl
   ```

4. **Place the Plugins in Geany's Plugin Directory:**

   Copy the Lua scripts (`copilot.lua` and `copywriter.lua`) to Geany's plugin or script directory, typically located at `~/.config/geany/plugins/` or a similar path depending on your operating system.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot/
   cp copilot.lua copywriter.lua ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot/
   ```

5. **Restart Geany:**

   After placing the plugins, restart Geany in case the lua scripts didn't load automatically.

## Configuration

Geany Copilot uses JSON settings files to manage its configurations for both code assistance and copywriting assistance. The settings include the OpenAI API base URL, API key, system prompts, and behavior preferences.

### Settings File Locations

- **Code Assistance Settings:**

  ```
  ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot/copilot.json
  ```

- **Copywriting Assistance Settings:**

  ```
  ~/.config/geany/plugins/geanylua/geany-copilot/copywriter.json
  ```

### Setting Up
1. **(Optional): Setup shortcuts**
   Open the Keybindings section under Geany Preferences. Scroll down to "Lua Script" sub-section and set the shortcut for both "Copilot" and "Copywriter". For example: <Super>backslash and <Super>Return respectively.

2. **Open Geany Copilot Settings Dialog:**

   In Geany, you can access the settings dialog through either a plugin menu or a keyboard shortcut. The initial dialog will feature a "Settings" button. Alternatively, you can directly invoke the settings dialog by typing and selecting ".gc conf" anywhere within the editor, followed by activating the keyboard shortcut.

3. **Configure API Settings:**

   - **Base URL:** Enter your OpenAI API base URL (e.g., `https://api.openai.com`).
   - **API Key:** Enter your OpenAI API key. This key is required to authenticate requests to the API.

   Note: Any compatible OpenAI API (OAI) is supported (i.e: ollama, llama-server, etc.)

4. **Customize System Prompt:**

   - **Code Assistance:** Defines the behavior of the AI assistant for coding tasks.
   - **Copywriting Assistance:** Defines the behavior of the AI assistant for copywriting tasks.

5. **Behavior Preferences:**

   - **Replace Selection:** Choose whether the AI-generated suggestion should replace the currently selected text.

6. **Save Settings:**

   Click the **Save** button to apply your configurations.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, Geany Copilot is ready to assist you with both code completions and copywriting tasks.

### Code Assistance

**Geany Copilot** for code assistance operates similarly to GitHub Copilot, providing intelligent code suggestions based on your current context within the Geany editor.

#### Triggering Code Completions

1. **Select Code Context:**

   - Use a designated keyboard shortcut.
   - Access via the plugin menu.

3. **Review Suggestions:**

   Geany Copilot will display a dialog with AI-generated code completion options (usually 1). Review the suggestions, select the one that best fits your needs and click Accept.

4. **Apply Completion:**

   Upon selection, the chosen code snippet will replace the original selection.

### Copywriting Assistance

**Geany Copilot** also offers creative copywriting assistance, helping you generate and refine written content directly within the Geany editor.

#### Performing Copywriting Tasks

1. **Select Text or Position Caret:**

   - To generate new content, place the caret where you want the text to be inserted.
   - To review or refine existing text, highlight the text you wish to work on.

2. **Invoke Copywriting Assistant:**

   - Use a designated keyboard shortcut.
   - Access via the plugin menu.

3. **Choose an Action:**

   - **Generate Content:** Create new text based on the provided context.
   - **Review Text:** Get constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

4. **Review and Apply Suggestions:**

   The assistant will display a dialog with AI-generated suggestions. Choose the appropriate option to insert or replace text, depending on your configuration.

## Migration Guide

## GeanyPy Installation Guide

### **For Linux Mint Users (Your System)**

Since you're using **Linux Mint with Geany 2.1.0**, here are the specific steps to install GeanyPy:

#### **Quick Installation**
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install GeanyPy (try these in order)
sudo apt install geany-plugin-py
# OR if the above fails:
sudo apt install geany-plugins

# Install Python GTK dependencies
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

#### **Verification Steps**
1. **Restart Geany completely**: `killall geany && geany`
2. **Open Plugin Manager**: Tools ‚Üí Plugin Manager
3. **Look for GeanyPy**: Should appear in the plugin list
4. **Enable GeanyPy**: Check the checkbox and click OK
5. **Test**: Look for Python plugin support

#### **Troubleshooting Script**
If GeanyPy doesn't appear, run our troubleshooting script:
```bash
./troubleshoot_geanypy.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Detect your exact Linux Mint version
- ‚úÖ Check for GeanyPy packages
- ‚úÖ Install missing dependencies
- ‚úÖ Test Python GTK bindings
- ‚úÖ Create a test plugin to verify functionality
- ‚úÖ Provide specific fixes for your system

#### **Alternative Package Names**
Different Linux distributions use different package names:

| Distribution | Package Name |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Linux Mint/Ubuntu/Debian** | `geany-plugin-py` or `geany-plugins` |
| **Fedora/CentOS** | `geany-plugins-geanypy` |
| **Arch Linux** | `geany-plugins` |
| **openSUSE** | `geany-plugin-geanypy` |

#### **Manual Verification**
Check if GeanyPy is installed:
```bash
# Check installed packages
dpkg -l | grep geany-plugin

# Look for GeanyPy files
find /usr -name "*geanypy*" 2>/dev/null
find /usr -name "*py.so" 2>/dev/null

# Test Python GTK
python3 -c "import gi; gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0'); from gi.repository import Gtk; print('GTK OK')"
```

#### **If GeanyPy Still Doesn't Work**
1. **Check detailed guide**: See [GEANYPY_INSTALLATION.md](GEANYPY_INSTALLATION.md)
2. **Use troubleshooting script**: `./troubleshoot_geanypy.sh`
3. **Fallback to Lua version**: Files preserved in `OLD/` directory
4. **Report issue**: Include your system details and error messages

### **Understanding GeanyPy vs Other Plugins**

**GeanyPy** is special because it's a "plugin framework" that allows Python scripts to act as Geany plugins:

- **Regular Geany plugins**: Written in C/C++, compiled as `.so` files
- **GeanyPy plugins**: Written in Python, loaded through GeanyPy framework
- **GeanyLua plugins**: Written in Lua (what we're migrating from)

**Why GeanyPy is Required:**
- Our Python plugin uses GeanyPy's API to integrate with Geany
- Without GeanyPy, Python plugins cannot access Geany's interface
- GeanyPy provides the bridge between Python and Geany's C API
